Listing for exercise 2
// A program containing errors!
# include <iostream>, <string>
# include <stdlib>
# void srand( seed);
int main()
{
string message "\nLearn from your mistakes!";
cout << message << endl;
int len = length( message);
cout << "Length of the string: " << len << endl;
// And a random number in addition:
int a, b;
a = srand(12.5);
b = rand( a );
cout << "\nRandom number: " << b << endl;
return 0;
}


Exercise 1
Create a program to calculate the square roots of the numbers
4
12.25
0.0121
and output them as shown opposite.Then read a number from the keyboard and
output the square root of this number.
To calculate the square root, use the function sqrt() , which is defined by the
following prototype in the math.h (or cmath ) header file:
double sqrt( double x);
The return value of the sqrt() function is the square root of x .

Exercise 2
The program on the opposite page contains several errors! Correct the errors
and ensure that the program can be executed.

Exercise 3
Create a C++ program that defines a string containing the following character
sequence:
I have learned something new again!
and displays the length of the string on screen.
Read two lines of text from the keyboard. Concatenate the strings using " * "
to separate the two parts of the string. Output the new string on screen.
