Exercise 1
What output is generated by the program on the page entitled “Formatted output
of floating-point numbers” in this chapter?

Exercise 2
Formulate statements to perform the following:
a. Left-justify the number 0.123456 in an output field with a width of 15.
b. Output the number 23.987 as a fixed point number rounded to two dec-
imal places, right-justifying the output in a field with a width of 12.
c. Output the number –123.456 as an exponential and with four decimal
spaces. How useful is a field width of 10?

Exercise 3
Write a C++ program that reads an article number, a quantity, and a unit price
from the keyboard and outputs the data on screen as displayed on the opposite
page.

Exercise 4
Write a C++ program that reads any given character code (a positive integer)
from the keyboard and displays the corresponding character and the character
code as a decimal, an octal, and a hexadecimal on screen.
Why do you think the character P is output when the number 336 is entered?
