Exercise 1
The sizeof operator can be used to determine the number of bytes occupied
in memory by a variable of a certain type. For example, sizeof(short) is
equivalent to 2.
Write a C++ program that displays the memory space required by each
fundamental type on screen.


Exercise 2
Write a C++ program to generate the screen output shown on the opposite
page.

Exercise 3
Which of the variable definitions shown on the opposite page is invalid or does
not make sense?

Exercise 4
Write a C++ program that two defines variables for floating-point numbers and
initializes them with the values
123.456 and 76.543
Then display the sum and the difference of these two numbers on screen.

NOTE:

FOR EXERCISE 2:

I
       "RUSH"
		\TO\
	AND		
/FRO/


FOR EXERCISE 3:

Defining and initializing variables:
int a(2.5);
int b = '?';
char z(500);
int big = 40000;
double he's(1.2E+5);
const long large;
char c('\'');
unsigned char ch = '\201';
unsigned size(40000);
float val = 12345.12345;
