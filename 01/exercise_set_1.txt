Exercise 1
Write a C++ program that outputs the following text on screen:
Oh what
a happy day!
Oh yes,
what a happy day!
//Use the manipulator endl where appropriate.
Exercise 2
The following program contains several errors:
*/ Now you should not forget your glasses //
#include <stream>
int main
{
cout << "If this text",
cout >> " appears on your display, ";
cout << " endl;"
cout << 'you can pat yourself on '
<< " the back!" << endl.
return 0;
)
Resolve the errors and run the program to test your changes.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void pause();
// Prototype
int main()
{
cout << endl << "Dear reader, "
<< endl << "have a ";
pause();
cout << "!" << endl;
return 0;
}
void pause()
{
cout << "BREAK";
