Screen output for exercise 2
// check pic 


Note on exercise 4
Use the function time() to initialize the random number generator:
#include <time.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
// Prototype of time()
// Prototypes of srand()
// and rand()
long sec;
time( &sec );
// Take the number of seconds and
srand( (unsigned)sec ); // use it to initialize.


Exercise 1
Rewrite the EuroDoll.cpp program in this chapter to replace both the for
loops with while loops.

Exercise 2
Write a C++ program that outputs a complete multiplication table (as shown
opposite) on screen.

Exercise 3
Write a C++ program that reads an integer between 0 and 65535 from the
keyboard and uses it to seed a random number generator.Then output 20
random numbers between 1 and 100 on screen.

Exercise 4
Write a program for the following numerical game:
The computer stores a random number between 1 and 15 and the player
(user) attempts to guess it.The player has a total of three attempts.After each
wrong guess, the computer tells the user if the number was too high or too low.
If the third attempt is also wrong, the number is output on screen.
The player wins if he or she can guess the number within three attempts.
The player is allowed to repeat the game as often as he or she wants.

n.b. Use the system time to seed the random number generator as shown opposite. The time() function
returns the number of seconds since 1/1/1970, 0:0. The long value of the sec variable is converted to
unsigned by unsigned(sec) and then passed to the srand() function.
